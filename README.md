* Draynor Village
* Draynor Manor
* Falador
* Rimmington
* Brimhaven
* Camelot
* Seers Village
* Ardougne
* Mor Ul Rek

* Keldagrim
* Yanille

# Screenshot Rules

In cases of wanting to submit new screenshots or replace old ones, please be sure to follow some basic principles:

* no screenshots of snowy white areas; people who play in the dark will thank you
* no bright sky setting in 117, use the tan skybox
* set shadows to a decent quality to avoid pixelation
* put new screenshots inside the `assets/images` folder
* modify `src/osrs.js` with your new path, otherwise it will not show up
* save it in the highest PNG format possible if doing image editing
* turn on entity hider when taking screenshots and disable NPC text

# Permissions

No permissions are needed unless future features are desirable. Features like an included search bar, top sites, or history are do-able, but would involve adding new layers of trust to the extension itself, which may not be desirable.
